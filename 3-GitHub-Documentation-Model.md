## 1. Analitical Conceptual Architecture
*Here, please put detail about the Conceptual architecture of the project*

## 2. Machine Learning Techniques
*List in order the Machine Leaning techniques that are involved in the process.*

*For the ones that import from a library, indicate its name.*

## 3. Data

### 3.1 Input
*Which inputs are needed for the solution (CSVs, parameters, database, parquet files)? And where will each of them be located (S3, Redshift)?*

*List all the input data following the next*


|Table Name|Table Format|AWS Location|Schema/S3 Path|
|---|---|---|---|
| *Name of the Table*   | *Is a database table, parquet file, csv file, etc.*  | *Where is the data Redshift or S3* | *where is located, if is in Redshift the name of the schema, if is in S3 the path where is the file*   |

### 3.2 Output
*Which outputs generate the model? And where will each of them be located (S3, Redshift)?*

*Which Project or Business Areas will use the data?*

*List all the input data following the next*


|Table Name|Table Format|AWS Location|Schema/S3 Path|
|---|---|---|---|
|*Name of the Table*| *Is a database table, parquet file, csv file, etc.*  | *Where is the data Redshift or S3* | *Where is located, if is in Redshift the name of the schema, if is in S3 the path where is the file*   |

## 4. Manual

*Instructions for executing the solution locally. Which scripts need to be run? *

* If the solution is executed from terminal, offer an example of how to execute the scripts.*

```python
print("Example Here!")
```

## 5. Reported Bugs
*List and short explanation of all the bugs that have been reported*

## 6. Acknowledgements
